# derive-roadmap-readout
## Requirements
- `cells-by-parent`: The operation groups the dispatch's `frontier` items by their declared `parent` cell (endeavor, campaign, project, or plan) into one readout cell per parent, each carrying its member items and its own ready/blocked/done counts.
- `horizon-by-composition`: The operation reads each item's modality and horizon by composing `@red-cup-engineering/classify-work-demand-service`'s `classifyWorkDemand` over the item's `scope` and `text`, then the founder's corner rule (Process/both-closed -> Determined/Now, Derivation/Delta-only -> Necessary/Soon, Procedure/sigma-only -> Possible/Later, Inquiry/neither -> Impossible-now/Eventually); it never reads or guesses a horizon from prose directly.
- `ready-blocked-from-item-state`: An item is `blocked` when its `structural.blockers` is non-empty, its `structural.state` (or `state`) is `"blocked"`, or its `coordination.state` is not `"clear"`; otherwise it is `ready`.
- `done-from-dispatch-count`: The readout's total `done` is the dispatch's own `done` count (a discharged item never appears in `frontier`, so `done` cannot be read from frontier items themselves); no discharge is invented or guessed at the item level.
- `money-from-ledger-only`: A `money` field appears in the readout only from the given `ledger` input; the operation never derives money from `dispatch` or `registry`.
- `stdout-only`: The operation returns a value; it performs no filesystem write of any kind. Its README states why: roadmaps are readouts, derived on demand, never a stored file (2026-09-06 ruling).
## Prohibitions
- `no-frontier-refusal`: The operation must refuse a request whose `dispatch.frontier` is not an array.
- `no-persistence`: The operation must never write its result, or any part of it, to a filesystem path; it is a pure transform from `{dispatch, ledger?, registry?}` to one `RoadmapReadout` value.
- `no-duplicate-scopes`: The operation must not emit two rows for the same `scope`; a repeated scope in `frontier` is read once.
## Laws
- `roadmaps-are-derived` | Roadmaps are derived from journaled work, never handwritten (ruling 2026-09-06) | v1 | services/561-group-services-section/data/records/2026-09-06-ruling-roadmaps-are-derived-from-journaled-work-never-handwritten.json | Applies to the whole operation. | A roadmap is a readout produced by an engineering service and derived from real tasks in the work journals; temporal state is never written into a permanent file.
- `work-orchestration-modality-horizon-force` | Work orchestration by modality, horizon, and force | v1 | services/561-group-services-section/content/text/documents/articles/notes/2026/09/04/2026-09-04-note-on-work-orchestration-by-modality-horizon-and-force.md | Applies to the horizon-by-composition requirement's corner rule. | A work record's horizon is derived from its modality by the founder's rule and never stored as an independent field that can drift.
- `nuclear-quartet-work-types` | Skillful-work quartet (Nuclear Quartet Theorem) | v1 | services/engineering-services-section/services/computer-engineering-services-section/services/computer-systems-engineering-services-section/services/agent-computer-system-engineering-services-section/services/agent-work-computer-system-engineering-services-section/content/text/documents/articles/specifications/skillful-work.md | Applies to the classify-work-demand composition. | Inquiry is the raw algebra, Procedure is Fix(sigma) meaning-closed, Derivation is Fix(delta) execution-closed, Process is both closed; the corner names the modality and horizon this operation reads.
- `admitted-example-face-equivalence` | JSNode operation face-equivalence law | v1 | services/engineering-services-section/services/computer-engineering-services-section/services/computer-code-engineering-services-section/services/javascript-engineering-services-section/services/javascript-code-fabrication-services-section/services/javascript-node-code-fabrication-services-section/services/jsnode-package-services-section/README.md | Applies to the shared examples projected to the JSNode import and command faces. | Every admitted example has equivalent import and command outputs under the downstream JSNode face assay.
## Standards
- `node-esm-operation` | Node.js | v24.2.0+ | https://nodejs.org/docs/v24/api/esm.html | Applies to the .mjs operation, its import.meta.main guard, and downstream package-birth assays. | The package uses one executable ESM operation source file that is eligible for downstream staged package-birth assays.
- `metroplat-agent-work-dispatch-schema` | metroplat.agent-work.dispatch-settlement (agent-work-dispatch) | v1 | https://ops.561.group/mcp | Applies to the shape of the `dispatch` input this operation reads. | The operation reads exactly the settlement's own fields (agents, blocked, coordination, date, done, evidence, feed, frontier, kind, malformed, policy, queue, ready, sourceRows, subject) and invents none of its own.
## Open questions
- `deeper-than-immediate-parent` [nonblocking]: "Cells grouped by parent (endeavor/campaign/project)" could mean the full ancestor chain up to a named level, not only the item's immediate declared `parent`; the dispatch settlement does not carry the ancestor chain per item (only a count of `sourceRows`), so this operation groups by the immediate `parent` field alone. Resolution blocked by: `agent-work-dispatch` carrying each item's full ancestor chain, or a founder ruling that immediate parent is the intended cell.
- `registry-rows-unused` [nonblocking]: `registry` rows are accepted and passed through verbatim but not yet folded into any cell (no requirement named what a registry row should change in a cell). Resolution blocked by: a founder ruling naming what a registry row contributes to a cell.
