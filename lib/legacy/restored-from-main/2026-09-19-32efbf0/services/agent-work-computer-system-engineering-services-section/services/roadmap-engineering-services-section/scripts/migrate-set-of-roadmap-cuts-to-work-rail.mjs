// One-time migration (2026-09-06 ruling: roadmaps are derived from journaled
// work, never handwritten): reads the thirty-two hand-written goal-stack
// roadmap cuts in true chronological order (each cut's own `recordedAt`,
// never filename order, which is not reliable for same-day cuts), derives
// one structured-work-intent per cut through the published operation package,
// and admits each to the production work rail. A roadmap cut contains an
// obligation, not an office, incumbent, duty, work, or skill, so it cannot
// lawfully manufacture an agency allocation. Allocation is a later operation
// over canonical firm authority and a declared work item.
