# classify-work-demand
## Requirements
- `demand-record`: The operation returns a WorkDemand record naming the work item's skillful-work type and its attention lane, with the two nuclei and the evidence that closed or left open each nucleus.
- `parameterized-grammar`: The repair-script scope kinds, checker-recognized scope kinds, and gated friction kinds are parameters of the request with declared defaults, never constants hidden in the operation.
## Prohibitions
- `missing-scope-refusal`: The operation must refuse a request whose scope is not a non-empty string.
- `no-inference-from-prose`: The operation must not close a nucleus from prose alone; only a named scope kind, a script path, or a command gate in the text closes one.
## Laws
- `admitted-example-face-equivalence` | JSNode operation face-equivalence law | v1 | services/engineering-services-section/services/computer-engineering-services-section/services/computer-code-engineering-services-section/services/javascript-engineering-services-section/services/javascript-code-fabrication-services-section/services/javascript-node-code-fabrication-services-section/services/jsnode-package-services-section/README.md | Applies to the shared examples projected to the JSNode import and command faces. | Every admitted example has equivalent import and command outputs under the downstream JSNode face assay.
- `nuclear-quartet-work-types` | Skillful-work quartet (Nuclear Quartet Theorem) | v1 | services/engineering-services-section/services/computer-engineering-services-section/services/computer-systems-engineering-services-section/services/agent-computer-system-engineering-services-section/services/agent-work-computer-system-engineering-services-section/content/text/documents/articles/specifications/skillful-work.md | Applies to the mapping from the two nuclei to the four work types. | Inquiry is the raw algebra, Procedure is Fix(sigma) meaning-closed, Derivation is Fix(delta) execution-closed, Process is both closed.
## Standards
- `node-esm-operation` | Node.js | v24.2.0+ | https://nodejs.org/docs/v24/api/esm.html | Applies to the .mjs operation, its import.meta.main guard, and downstream package-birth assays. | The package uses one executable ESM operation source file that is eligible for downstream staged package-birth assays.
